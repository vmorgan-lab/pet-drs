# PET DRS
PET DRS algorithm to assess targeting of lateralized FDG-PET hypometabolism for epilepsy surgery planning.

# Prerequisites
SPM12 is a prerequesite to run this script and can be downloaded here for free: https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/

*Make sure that SPM12 is in your path when running this script

Note that this script was developed and tested using MATLAB 2021a.

# Inputs
Imaging

This script takes T1-weighted MRI and FDG-PET images in NIFTI format as inputs. They should be placed in the "parent directory" folder and named "T1.nii" and "PET.nii", respectively. All outputs will be placed in this parent directory folder.

Resection

The regions in the planned resection are to be defined using the AAL atlas (see AAL_regions.txt). Users input a vector of numbers corresponding to the labels (third column in AAL_regions.txt) of the regions to be resected. Users can also use one of the predefined resections within the code ('Right ATL', 'Left ATL', 'Right SAH', or 'Left SAH').

Registration

Once this script is run the first time on a patient's data with reg = 1, the registration information has been saved and reg can be set to 0 for subsequent tests of alternative resections to decrease processing time.

Folder Names

You will also need to name the folders where the imaging data is (parent directory) and the name of the folder where you would like to store the results of the specific simulated resection you are testing. See script for where to input each of these.

# Outputs
PET Laterality Image

The PET laterality image will be outputted into the parent directory and named PET_LI.nii (along with several intermediate images from the registration process).The PET_LI.nii image can be overlaid on the wT1.nii image (patient's T1 in MNI space) or the MNI template for visualization (see examples made with MRIcroGL (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricrogl) in Sainburg et al., 2025).

Simulated Resection Result

A folder with the name of the sim_res_fname you have defined will be placed in the parent directory and contain a swarmchart PNG with the PET DRS score of the resection, along with a .txt file containing the regions defined as resected.
Note that as per Sainburg et al., 2025, a PET DRS < 0.22 would be considered a favorable score.

# Example Usage (put T1.nii and PET.nii in "test_folder"):
Resection of right amygdala and hippocampus (right selective amygdalohippocampectomy):

pet_drs('test_folder',[4102,4202],'rsah',1)

pet_drs('test_folder','Right SAH','rsah',1)

# Example Report
See pet_drs_report_example.pdf for an example of how this code could be used to generate a report for a patient's FDG-PET scan.

# Notes
We encourage others to edit and adjust this algorithm to their own needs. For example, other *anatomically symmetric* atlases could be substituted for the AAL atlas
